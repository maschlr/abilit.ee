      <p>
        I’m Marten Schlüter, a German engineer with over two decades of coding
        experience and a degree in Energy Systems Engineering. From designing
        industrial power systems to pioneering software-driven efficiencies,
        I’ve always been driven by curiosity and a passion for solving complex
        problems. In 2022, I took a leap of faith, moving to Panama to embrace a
        life closer to nature and freedom. This journey inspired me to found my
        software consulting company in Estonia, a hub for innovation and global
        collaboration. With a focus on data-driven applications, my mission is
        to empower businesses worldwide by delivering efficient, scalable, and
        tailored solutions.

      <p>
        I’ve spent years working on diverse projects, from industrial emergency

        difference. At the heart of everything I do is a commitment to freedom
        and independence—values that guide not just my life but also the way I
        help businesses achieve their goals.
