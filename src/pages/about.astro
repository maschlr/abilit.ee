      <Hr />

      <p>
        We're a software engineering consultancy that ships. Based in Estonia,
        we work with startups and growing companies worldwide who need
        production-ready solutions fast. No endless planning cycles. No
        over-engineered architectures that collapse under real-world use. Just
        pragmatic engineering and solid architecture that scales from day one.

      <h2>Why Work With Us?</h2>
      <p>
        We focus on outcomes, not credentials. When you work with us, you get:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Business value first</strong> - We build what moves your
          business forward, not what looks impressive in a tech blog. Every
          feature needs to justify its existence.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>True ownership</strong> - One team accountable for your
          entire stack. No finger-pointing between frontend, backend, and
          infrastructure specialists.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>High agency</strong> - We solve problems proactively. If
          something's blocking progress, we find a way through instead of
          waiting for permission.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Available when it counts</strong> - Shipping on Friday?
          Launch day? We're there. Responsibility means being present when
          stakes are high.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        Speed and quality aren't opposites. You can move fast without creating
        technical debt that slows you down later. We build clean architectures
        that won't need complete rewrites when you hit 10k users. We ship
        production-ready code from day one—proper error handling, monitoring,
        and security built in, not bolted on later.
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn't about perfection. It's about pragmatic engineering: making
        the right tradeoffs, choosing appropriate tools, and building
        foundations that let you scale confidently when growth happens.
      </p>

      <h2>Who We Work With</h2>
      <p>
        We work with funded startups ready to build their MVP and growing
        companies launching new products. Our clients need dedicated technical
        execution—not consulting reports or month-long discovery phases. They
        have clear goals and tight timelines, and they need a technical partner
        who can move at their speed.
      </p>

      <h2>Ready to Start?</h2>
      <p>
        If you have a clear goal and need a technical partner who can execute
        fast without compromising quality, let's talk. No sales pitches, no
        endless discovery phases. Just a straightforward conversation about your
        project and how we can help you ship.
