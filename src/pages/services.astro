      <h2>Full-Stack Development</h2>
      <p class="text-lg italic">Ship your product in weeks, not months</p>
      <p>
        You have funding and a market opportunity. What you need is a technical
        partner who can move fast without cutting the wrong corners. We build
        production-ready MVPs using modern backend frameworks (Python, Node.js,
        Next.js) and responsive frontends, delivering complete applications that
        can scale from day one.
      </p>
      <p><strong>What you get:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Speed without technical debt</strong> - Clean architecture that
          won't need rewriting at 10k users
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>End-to-end ownership</strong> - From database design to deployment,
          you get one person accountable for the entire stack
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Right tool for the job</strong> - Python/FastAPI for data-heavy
          systems, Next.js for full-stack apps, Node.js for real-time features -
          whatever fits your use case
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Production-ready from launch</strong> - Proper error handling,

          Teams that need to validate ideas quickly with real, working software
        </li>

      <h2>AI Integration & Workflows</h2>
      <p class="text-lg italic">
        Beyond ChatGPT wrappers - AI that actually works for your business
      </p>
      <p>
        LLMs are powerful, but integrating them into production systems requires
        more than API calls. We build custom AI agents and workflows that solve
        real business problems - from intelligent document processing to
        autonomous task execution.
      </p>
      <p><strong>What you get:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Custom AI agents</strong> - Build autonomous agents that handle
          complex workflows, make decisions, and take actions in your systems
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>RAG systems that work</strong> - Turn your company knowledge into
          actionable intelligence with retrieval-augmented generation
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Production-grade integrations</strong> - OpenAI, Anthropic, local
          models - whatever gives you the best performance and cost structure
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Real business value</strong> - Not AI features for the sake of
          AI, but solutions that reduce manual work and unlock new capabilities
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Ideal for:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Products that need intelligent features (chat, summarization, data
          extraction)
        </li>
        <li>
          Companies with complex workflows that could be automated with AI agents
        </li>
        <li>
          Businesses sitting on unstructured data (documents, conversations,
          logs) that needs to become useful
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We don't build ChatGPT wrappers. We build AI systems that integrate
        deeply with your business logic and actually ship value.
      </p>

      <h2>DevOps & Infrastructure</h2>
      <p class="text-lg italic">Scale confidently from day one</p>
      <p>
        Fast deployment is great. Fast, reliable, observable deployment is
        better. We build CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure that let you ship
        with confidence - from your first users to your millionth.
      </p>
      <p><strong>What you get:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Automated deployment pipelines</strong> - Push to main, tests
          run, code deploys. No manual steps, no deployment anxiety
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Infrastructure as code</strong> - Reproducible, version-controlled
          infrastructure that scales with your needs
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Monitoring and observability</strong> - Know what's happening in
          production before your users tell you something's broken
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Right-sized solutions</strong> - Not enterprise over-engineering,
          not duct-tape scripts. Infrastructure that fits your current stage and
          grows with you
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Ideal for:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Startups moving from "works on my machine" to real production systems
        </li>
        <li>
          Growing companies where manual deployments are becoming a bottleneck
        </li>
        <li>
          Teams that need reliable infrastructure without hiring a full-time
          DevOps engineer
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We don't build infrastructure for the sake of infrastructure. We build
        systems that let you ship faster and sleep better.
